#.one(event,callback);

```

Binds an event to each element in the collection that will only execute once.  When it executes, we remove the event listener then right away so it no longer happens
            
```

##Example

```
            $().one("click",function(){console.log("I was clicked once");});
            
```



##Parameters
```
event      String|Object
[callback]      Function

```

##Returns
```
appframework - object
```

$.query(selector,[context]) is faster then using $() to find an element using a query selector.

$() has a lot of logic to handle finding elements, turning arrays/objects into a collection, etc.

$.query lets you jump right to the query selector engine and returns an App Framework collection.  You should use this when possible.


When context is passed in, it must be a DOM node to search within.

```
var divs=$.query("divs");

var elem=$.query("#main");

var lis=$.query("li",$("#main").get(0));
```
