#$.ui.showModal();

```

Load a content panel in a modal window.  We set the innerHTML so event binding will not work.  Please use the data-load or panelloaded events to setup any event binding
 
```

##Example

```
 $.ui.showModal("#myDiv","fade");
 
```


##Parameters

```
panel                         String|Object
[transition]                  String

```

##Returns

```
undefined
```

##Detail

$.ui.showModal() will load a panel as a modal window (full overlay).

Because we use .html(), events are not registered.  Please use the data-load or "loadpanel" event to wire them for that modal window.


```
$.ui.showModal("#$.ui.showModal");
```

Show this page as a modal window.

<input type="button" onclick="$.ui.showModal('#$_ui_showModal')" value="Show Modal">
